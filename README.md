Pure HTML CSS and Javascript
TODO Application

I was able to add the add , remove, delete functions. I have also added the local storage for database management. Also have included some functionalities like filtering tasks on the basis of either date range, priority or category. Also have added the Sort functions which will sort the task list on the basis of either priority or due date.
Search feature has also been added, where the search input catches all the tasks that have the input string somewhere either in task name or tags.

I was not able to add the date auto update feature, also the drag and drop feature was a little complicated for me. I did tried adding subtasks too but it created many errors and I faced difficulties.
